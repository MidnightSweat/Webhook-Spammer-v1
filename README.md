# Webhook-Spammer
Welcome to the Moonlight Sender webhook spammer,thanks for peeking in this project I've made

to run the program simply copy the code to a notepad and name the file "main.py" after make sure you have python installed on your PC, "python.org" then on notepad click file then save as then name main.py, after click save for all files, after you've completed that add a .ico file into a folder with the main.py file, then in cmd prompt if the folder is in your downloads tab type "cd C:\Users\YOUR NAME\Downloads\Webhook Spammer V1" e.g.
after type DIR to check the files inside the folder then type "python main.py" to open the file.

if ur a nerd execute this like a normal py file
